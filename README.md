### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: The Commander in Chief Vs The Reality TV Star
+ This project is conducted by Yiran Li

+ Project summary: Both FDR and Donald Trump are important political figures to study. In this project, I used various text mining techniques and sentimental analysis to make the argument that the difference in their speech are indicative of their drastically diverging attitudes towards the presidency of the United States as well as their disparate characters.
